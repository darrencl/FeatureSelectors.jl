`UnivariateFeatureSelector` has the following fields:

* `method::Function` (required)- Method to calculate feature importance. The
  method chosen will determine the scoring. Below is the scring with available
  statistical method to obtain them.

    * Correlation - higher score means more important

        * `pearson_correlation`

    * P-value - lower score means more important

        * `f_test`
        * `chisq_test`

* `k::Union{Int64,Nothing}` - Select top `k` features with the highest correlation to target
  variable. You could ignore this by specifying k == nothing. This defaults to nothing.
* `threshold::Union{Float64,Nothing}` - Select features with correlation more than or equal
  to threshold. To ignore, simply set threshold to nothing (default behavior).

Select features based on the importance, which is defined by `selector.method`
to target `y`. if `verbose` is true, logs will be printed - this defaults to
false. This function will return only the feature names of selected features.

If you have feature `X_data` as matrix and feature names `X_features` as a
Vector, you can replace `X` with `X_data` and `X_features` (in this order).
